            <h1>Dark Souls Bosses</h1>

            <p>
                One of Dark Souls staples in its franchise is the diverse amount of bosses throught all its games. 
                The primary Machanics of the game is to defeat dark enemies through trial and error finding their
                weaknesses and coming back to use that to your advantage. Each boss bring a unique struggle and
                fighting style upon arrival. Each game ties themselves into a single world and throughout each game 
                the previous one you have defeated play some role in the lore explained in other games.

            <h3>World Building Effects on the Bosses</h3>

            <p>
                Below shows what is expected of the games. The dark and deserted world emphesises 
                a fear of darkness and emptiness, to see a boss within this world gives it much more 
                weight than if it was out in the open. The world builds this boss to be the pinnacle of 
                this domain and helps a player grasp what they are up against.
