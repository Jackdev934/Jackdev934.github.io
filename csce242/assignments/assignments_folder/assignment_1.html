        <h2> Who and What makes Indie Music?</h2>
        <p> 
            The term indie music has a broad drapped title over much of the music industry. 
            In a dictonary term indie is short for independant and it was used to describe a band who wasn't signed to a major record label and wasn't apart of mainstream song.
            Now the title more entails previously named indie artists from the 2000's and more represents the subgenre of rock known as alternative. 
            Indie is still seen as underground and non-mainstream, but much of the underground music is catagorized within its own specified sub-genre.
