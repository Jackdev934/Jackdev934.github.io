        <h2> What is Indie Music?</h2>
        <p> 
            The term indie music has a broad drapped title over much of the music industry. 
            In a dictonary term indie is short for independant it was used to describe a band who wasn't signed to a major record label and wasn't apart of mainstream song and seen as experimental.
            Now the title more entails previously named indie artists from the 2000's and more represents the subgenre of rock known as alternative. 
            Indie is still seen as underground and non-mainstream, but much of the underground music is catagorized within its own specified sub-genre.

        <h2> Why I started Listening to Indie </h2>
        <p> Much of my music taste revolves around indie and I was introduced to it by my parents. 
            When I was younger my parents would play a lot of music from The Killers and from Arctic Monkeys and throughout the years I began picking up more of an interest from the genre as a whole. 
            Another way I was introduced was through the game RockBand, I started playing it a lot as a kid and took a liking to a lot of songs that were considered alternative rock and indie. 
            With both of these causing a major impact in my music taste I have found much of what I listen to being indie and personally found that it is one thing I;ve grown more passionate about.</p>
